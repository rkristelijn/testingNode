==

Updates:
- coffee-script -> coffeescript
- --compilers -> --require: https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/compilers-deprecation

Learners:
- have the package describe its own validators to separate concerns
- use the common node assert()
- positive tests, negative tests, better descriptors
- redundant testing in happy trail vs sad path
- ask myself why I copy each property in the object itself, describing it over and over again, is this really necessary with underscore
- spell check on source code
